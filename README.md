# YOLOs-CPP

YOLOs-CPP is a fast and lightweight C++ implementation of multiple YOLO versions (from YOLOv5 to YOLOv12), using ONNX Runtime and OpenCV.  
It supports object detection, segmentation, oriented bounding boxes (OBB), and pose estimation â€” optimized for real-time inference.

> Built for speed, efficiency, and easy integration into production systems.
